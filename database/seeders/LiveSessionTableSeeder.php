        Welcome to ICBMâ€™s Industry Connect Program. We are excited to have you here with us.<br>
Industry Speak helps students improve their learning experience in a more interactive and
topic-specific way. This method offers a new perspective to shortlisted topics and exposes
students to teachings drawn from industry experts\' real-life experiences. The nature of this
method is such that even a seemingly dull or unclear topic becomes more interesting and a
better one-to-many approach is achieved. Apart from this, it also introduces students to potential careers and jobs they can opt for, once they get out of their respective colleges/universities.<br>
